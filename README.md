## Future Development

Jester is a work in progress! We have exciting features we want to implement in the future including:

- a like button
- viewing past tasks and their associated jests
- 

## Technologies Used

We used React for the front end and GraphQL and MongoDB for the backend. Coding was done using Node in VS Code.
